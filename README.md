# MyJournal

Take back your privacy and prevent snooping (somewhat)

### Why I made it:

- Note, what I mean by journal, is the "Boy version of a diary, just online"

One of my teachers had decided to go through my journal (private) because I said something "mean" about someone. I just talked about how he was being rude.
Then she decided to take pictures of my journal. Then she took away my computer privalages for a year.

### How does it store notes?
